# 32-Point-FFT-in-verilog
In 32-point FFT, there are five stages, which contain unique butterfly structure. Input is taken in normal order at first stage and the inputs for other stages dependence upon output generated by preceding stage butterfly structure. The output is taken in bit-reversal order at last stage.
